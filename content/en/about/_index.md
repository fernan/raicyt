RAICYT is the Network of Authorities of Science and Technology Institutes of Argentina. Formed at the beginning of this year, more than 400 authorities from various Science and Technology organizations participate in RAICyT throughout our country. Members belong to CONICET, the Universities and other scientific and technological institutions. At RAICYT all areas of knowledge are represented, from Social Sciences and Humanities, through Agricultural, Engineering and Materials Sciences, to Biological and Health Sciences and Exact and Natural Sciences.

The network was formed as a response to the fierce budgetary adjustment promoted
by the national government, which threatens the continuity of ongoing research
projects and the operation of our institutes, and is already driving a new
exodus of young scientists and the destruction of research groups that have
taken years to build and consolidate, in all disciplinary areas. 

The main aim of RAICYT is to defend the national scientific and technology
system. We believe that without science there is no promising future
possible for the development of our country.
